# Advanced Black-Scholes Option Pricing & Analysis Platform

This repository provides a comprehensive Black-Scholes options analysis platform that combines theoretical pricing models with real-time market data. The application helps traders identify mispriced options, analyze risk through Greeks, and build complex options strategies with interactive visualizations.

**Live Demo:** [(https://blackscholestrading.streamlit.app/)]

## Features:

### 1. **Real-Time Options Pricing & Greeks**

- Calculate theoretical option values using the Black-Scholes model
- Display all Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) with explanations
- Compare theoretical prices with actual market prices to spot opportunities
- Interactive charts showing how Greeks change across different price levels

### 2. **Live Market Data Integration**

- Fetch real-time stock prices and options chains from Yahoo Finance
- Calculate and display historical volatility
- Load actual bid/ask spreads, volume, and open interest
- Analyze implied volatility smile and term structure

### 3. **Enhanced Visualizations**

- Clean, spaced-out heatmaps showing option prices across spot price and volatility ranges
- 3D surface plots for visual option pricing analysis
- Monte Carlo simulation with price path visualization
- Portfolio payoff diagrams for strategy analysis

### 4. **Options Chain Analysis**

- Browse live options chains with advanced filtering (expiration, type, moneyness)
- Color-coded ITM/OTM options for quick identification
- Implied volatility analysis with smile visualization
- Open interest distribution charts

### 5. **Portfolio Builder**

- Build multi-leg options strategies (straddles, spreads, condors, etc.)
- Calculate aggregate portfolio Greeks
- Risk metrics including max profit/loss and breakeven points
- Probability of profit calculations

### 6. **User-Friendly UI**

- Date picker for expiration selection (no more confusing year decimals)
- Toggle between percentage and decimal inputs for volatility and rates
- Reference guides for typical volatility ranges and current treasury rates
- Tabbed interface for organized feature access

## üìù Technical Details

### Black-Scholes Implementation
The core pricing engine implements the full Black-Scholes formula:
- **Call Price**: `C = S√óN(d1) - K√óe^(-rT)√óN(d2)`
- **Put Price**: `P = K√óe^(-rT)√óN(-d2) - S√óN(-d1)`

### Greeks Calculations
All Greeks are calculated analytically:
- **Delta**: First derivative with respect to underlying price
- **Gamma**: Second derivative (delta sensitivity)
- **Theta**: Time decay rate
- **Vega**: Volatility sensitivity
- **Rho**: Interest rate sensitivity

### Monte Carlo Validation
Simulations use geometric Brownian motion:
- Thousands of price paths generated
- Statistical convergence analysis
- Comparison with analytical solutions
